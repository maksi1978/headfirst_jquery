- we need "Go Vegetarian" button that automatically subtitutes the vegetarian options on our web page menu

How subtitutions work:
- no subtitutes for our fish entries, so we need those removed
- we offer giant portobello mushrooms as a vegetarian substitute for our hamburgers
- we offer tofu as a vegetarian substitute for all of our meat and egg dishes except hamburgers

- we need a button that restores the menu to its original state
